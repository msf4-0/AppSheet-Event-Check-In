Appsheet is a platform that provides a zero-code development environment to create mobile,tablet and web application by using cloud-based spreadsheet and database platform data sources.

## 1. Copying Application Template

2. Click on the template called "Event Check-in", then "Copy and Customzie".
3. The name of the app can be changed or it can be left as default. Then "Copy App".

## 2. Editing The Template
After the app has been cloned, a new Google Form needs to be created and linked with the app.

### 2.1 Creating new Google Form
1. Create a new form by typing "forms.new" in browser.
2. First question is "Full Name" with Short Answer option.
3. Secon question is "Phone Number" with Short Answer option. Then open the menu on bottom right of the question and enable Response validation. First column is set as "Number", second column is set as "Is Number", third column can be set with any error message the user would see if an invalid character is entered. This is to ensure user insert only numbers as answers.
4. Third question is "Event" with Dropdown option. For now populate it with "Event 1" ... "Event 10" as shown:
